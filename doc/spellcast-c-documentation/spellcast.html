<h1>Spellcast</h1>
<h3>A game of duelling wizards</h3>
<h4>designed by Richard Bartle</h4>
<h4>X version by Andrew Plotkin</h4>

<p>
<em>Spellcast</em> is a multiplayer strategy game for Unix machines
running X windows.
</p>

<p>
It concerns a conflict between two or more powerful wizards. The
opponents use mystical hand gestures to invoke their spells --
spells of summoning, elemental energy, protection, psionic influence,
and good old-fashioned brute force.
Each wizard has two hands, a sequence of gestures can contain 
multiple spells, and some spells require two-handed gestures. This
means that timing and forethought
are necessary to insure that your defensive spells
block all attacks while your attacks get through.
</p>

<p>
(And before anyone asks -- the rules for this game were written a decade before
<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> hit the shelves. I wrote this X version a year or
so before <em>Magic</em> came out. Anyway, it doesn't resemble <em>Magic</em>
even slightly, except for being about two wizards trying to fry each 
other's asses. So there.)
</p>

<p>
<em>Spellcast</em> is <em>free</em> (yee-ha!)

Here is a screen shot</a> of <em>Spellcast</em> (monochrome GIF image, 23K).

<p>
You can <a href="http://eblong.com/zarf/ftp/spellcast.tar.Z">download the source code.</a> It's a tarred, compressed file, about 129K. It should build easily on any Unix platform with X windows.
</p>

<p>
You can also get it from any comp.sources.games archive on the Net. 
Unfortunately, there is a bug in that version (patchlevel 1), and the 
comp.sources.games moderator dropped into null-space before the patch 
went out. Downloading it from this page is your best bet.

<h3>History</h3>

<p>
The original paper-and-pencil version of this game,
entitled 
<em>Spellbinder,</em>
was created by Richard Bartle; it was printed in his zine
<em>Sauce of the Nile.</em>
He attempted to have it commercially
produced, but apparently didn't get very far. 
(Note: Richard Bartle wishes me to say that he is not dead. He 
can be contacted at
76703.3042@compuserve.com.)
</p>

<p>
It was reprinted (with some changes) as 
<em>Spellcaster</em>
in the fanzine 
<em>Duel Purpose,</em>
written by Mike Lean. From there, it was scanned and
posted to the Net by Andrew Buchanan 
(buchanan@heron.enet.dec.com). I grabbed it and wrote
this X version. Richard Bartle has given his permission to
distribute it as long as it remains free.
