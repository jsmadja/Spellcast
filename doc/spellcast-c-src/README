Spellcast is a strange little strategy game, which I found
on the Net and have implemented for X.

Basically, two or more players try to vaporize each other
with a wide assortment of wizardly spells. For the complete 
rules, see the man page (spellcast.6), which goes into 
exhaustive detail.

Compiling should be straightforward; spellcast uses only 
Xlib, with no widget sets or other libraries. 

NOTE: Some (all?) versions of SunOS have a buggy
realloc(), which causes spellcast to crash early and often.
If you're on a Sparc and you have this problem, the fix
is to compile with -lbsdmalloc. Uncomment the OTHERLIBS
line in the Makefile.

The Makefile begins with a few definitions which you 
can change:
the directories where everything gets installed;
the default fonts that the program tries to load (usually 
	times 14, helvetica 12, and fixed, in that order);
the directory in which game transcripts are stored (usually
	/tmp.)

Type "make" or "make spellcast" to create the executable.

"make stupid" will create a version of the game with a
terribly stupid, text-only interface -- this is not very
playable, and is really only good for testing. You enter
all the players' moves in a single string at the prompt,
and answer questions as they appear.

The file spelllist.ps is a PostScript document showing all
the available spells, in two columns: one sorted by gesture,
and one sorted by name. By default, it will be installed as
DESTDIR/lib/spellcast/spelllist.ps.

The original paper-and-pencil version of this game was
created by Richard Bartle (76703.3042@compuserve.com).
